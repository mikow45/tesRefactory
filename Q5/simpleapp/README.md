## I create an application using the Vue Js Framework
-. Based on a design on Figma, I created a simple application. There are files that I created:
    1. App.vue in /src/
    2. Home.vue in /src/views/
    3. tasklist.vue in /src/components/
    4. home.css in /src/assets/
    5. tasklist.css /src/assets/
    6. topnav.css /src/assets/

-. For the navigation, I save it in the App.vue file
-. For the Home section, I saved in /src/views/Home.vue. it also contains a code for Modal.
-. In the Home section, I also linked the task list.vue component file to make the code look slimmer and tidier in every part
-. Then on the /assets/ section, i use it to save the css or icon file




##
-. I finished the desktop view but had trouble when i wanted to create the calendar feature, either in Modal or not. So that I can't make this feature yet.
-. I use a node package manager to deploy the web
-. I use bootstrap in development


That's all, thanks.
